# render-gpt

A Chrome extension to render structured output from ChatGPT into rich text and other views.


## Usage
I've had success giving the following as an initial prompt for the conversation:


> For this conversation, please output HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (when appropriate) in a single code block, tagged with HTML. For example:
> 
>       ```html 
>       <some stuff>
>       ```
> 
> Such that the return could be rendered in an iframe. Does that sound good?
